# Differences Compared to Popchrom #

Not to be taken too seriously, this is just my first impression in quick testing.

## Differences ##

  * XML export/import.

## Benefits ##

  * Can cycle through all existing abbreviations without entering an abbreviation (called a label in MyWords terms) first.

## Disadvantages ##

  * Does not support abbreviation arguments.

  * Does not have any support to insert dates or clipboard content.

  * Does not seem to work in Gmail compose window.

  * UI does not scale well to large number of abbreviation (too bulky).

## Converters ##
