Images for Chrome Web Store

These have been reverse-engineered by downloading images of Popchrom V1.7
(in webp format) from the CWS.

They were converted to PNG with
https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/download

E.g. dwebp.exe screenshot2of3.webp -o screenshot2of3.png

These PNG images were then scaled to 640x400 pixes using Gimp.

These images are:

screenshot1of3.png
screenshot2of3.png
screenshot3of3.png
